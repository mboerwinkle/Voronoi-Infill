make lineCount and lineList not have unused indeces on uncalculated z coords
make sortPointList operate based on x or y variation and not distance (for speed)
make ORBitarray test suite
make genBitarray/setBit/getBit macros?
make sure functions are passed by reference
make sure functions decrement to 0, not increment to a value(to check if neccessary)
